# Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic command-line calculator implemented in Python. It can perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to run in a terminal or command prompt, providing a simple interface for performing calculations.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This calculator was developed using Python 3.

### Running the Calculator

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd python-calculator
   ```

3. Run the calculator.

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

## Usage

- Enter one of the following options to select an operation: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', or 'quit' to exit.
- Enter the first number.
- Enter the second number.
- The calculator will display the result of the operation.

## Error Handling

The calculator handles the 'ZeroDivisionError' when attempting to divide by zero. It will display an error message and prompt for new input.

## Examples

- To perform addition:
